# BigClock-lib v2
This repo was archived on 2022-10-11. I didn't have any intention of coming back to it as I'd mostly been satisfied with a working clock.

However, in recent weeks I've been picking up and improving many of my abandoned projects. This is one of them. Also, I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi Pico boards laying around and I love working with the RP2040, so that's definitely a big influence.

Anywho, between when I last worked on this, and now, I've picked up quite the distaste for Python. Micro/CircuitPython is amazing, but it's just not for me, so I've stuck with C++.



I originally gathered the files from Ivan Miranda's website. However, it looks as though both the video and webpage are no longer available. That being said, I did manage to find a [version of it on Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126233712/https://ivanmiranda.com/pages/diy-big-digital-clock)
