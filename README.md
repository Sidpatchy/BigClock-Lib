# BigClock Lib v1.2
This is pretty slow code, I am working on an update to allow for multi-threading.

This repo has been private because I was embarrased of how slow and inefficient the code is, I am making it public simply because I am referencing this project elsewhere.

Let me quick note, I gathered the CAD files for the body of the clock from Ivan Miranda. https://www.ivanmiranda.com/#/diy-big-digital-clock/
